While running the crawler and indexer:
1- If we are running for the first time, we should make some empty files named Saved_Links.txt, Unvisited_Links.txt, Visited_Links.txt, Content_Links.txt and SeedsOutput.txt
2- If an interruption occured, we leave the files with its data so while running again it will continue running.
3- If an interruption occured and we want to start from the first, we should open these 5 files ana delete their content.



To run the GUI:
1-Add the SearchEngine folder to the webapps folder in your apache directory.
2-type http://localhost:8080/SearchEngine/SearchEngine.html in your browser.

Note: classes folder contains the built files of the project "SearchForm" in case of changing any thing in this project you need to rebuild it and add these classes again to the classes folder
